# Cat Space

This is a front end project built for my coding Bootcamp. Because the internet loves cats and I needed to demonstrate what we have learnt in the first 4 weeks, I have chosen to use cats as my subject. On the page you can find Images, audios about cats. Also if you want to see more madnes you are able to contact me through the contact page.
